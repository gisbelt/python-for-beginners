## **How can I check if I already have Python 3 installed on my computer?**

It's possible that your computer already has Python 3 installed. Sometimes, applications install Python 3 without your knowledge.

### **Linux**

Python comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu).

To determine if your Linux computer already has Python 3 installed:

1. Open a Linux terminal session. The instructions for opening this session depend on your distribution and Linux version. Refer to your Linux distribution's online documentation for instructions on how to open a terminal session.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    

The output may include the word `Python` followed by a set of numbers separated by periods (`.`), for example:
```bash
Python 3.10.0
```

### **Windows**

To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3 installed:

1. To open the **Command Prompt** application, go to **Start** on the Windows taskbar.
2. Type **cmd** in the Windows search box and select the **Command Prompt** application from the **Best match** section of the results.Type the following command and press Enter:

	```bash
	python --version
	```

	or

	```bash
	py --version
	```

If the word `Python` is displayed followed by a set of numbers separated by periods (`.`), it means you have a version of Python installed. This is an example of the output you might get:
```bash
Python 3.10.0
```
